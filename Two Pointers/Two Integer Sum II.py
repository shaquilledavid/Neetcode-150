#Two Integer Sum II
def twoSum(numbers, target):
    """Given an array of integers numbers that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

    Return the indices (1-indexed) of two numbers, [index1, index2], such that they add up to a given target number target and index1 < index2. Note that index1 and index2 cannot be equal, therefore you may not use the same element twice.

    There will always be exactly one valid solution.

    Your solution must use 
    O
    (
    1
    )
    O(1) additional space.

    Example 1:

    Input: numbers = [1,2,3,4], target = 3

    Output: [1,2]
    Explanation:
    The sum of 1 and 2 is 3. Since we are assuming a 1-indexed array, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

    Constraints:

    2 <= numbers.length <= 1000
    -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
    -1000 <= target <= 1000
    """
    a = 0
    b = len(numbers) - 1

    while numbers[a] + numbers[b] != target:
        if numbers[a] + numbers[b] < target:
            a += 1
        elif numbers[a] + numbers[b] > target:
            b -= 1
        else:
            return [a+1,b+1]

    return [a+1, b+1]
